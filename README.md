# Homework 19: PWA Text Editor

## Description

This week's task was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

To build this text editor, I've started with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. I've used a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.

Rather than forking/cloning the Repo to your machine, check out the application by the Deployed Heroku Link below:

## Installation

Clone or Fork the Repo to your machine and `npm install` in the command line in the root of the Repo to first install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage 

Enter `npm run start` after installing all required dependencies to run the server and open "localhost:3000" on your brower. This application also works offline!
